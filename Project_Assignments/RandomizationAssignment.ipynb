One case is known to be filled with one ounce less than all the other bottles.  A former student proposed a random selection method for finding the case with the bottles that have less water.  Essentially you'll pull one bottle and test it.  If it is 9 ounces, you have found the case that is short.  Let's explore this random test.\n",

At that point, they are shuffled before returning to the stack in the cabinet.  Add this to your randomization and compute the probability of pulling exactly one and at least one pink plate when setting the table for four.\n",
        "6. Since my daughter will not eat unless on the pink plate, most of the pink plates have migrated to the top of the stack.  This happened through a rejection of pull process.  In this, if we did not have at least one pink, more plates were removed from the stack until a pink was found.  Those rejected plates were then returned to the stack.  Create a function for doing this.\n",
        "7. We have lived in the house for 1000 days.  Run your experiment on your stack always appeasing my daughter with at least one pink plate.  How often do you have all pink plates in the stack?\n",
